        <h2>Why Houston?</h2>
        <h3>Houston, the Space City</h3>
        <p>
            The Second World War changed the world as we knew it forever. 
            As one of the most prominent participants, the USA had a 
            massive recession to recover from, despite being on the 
            winning side. Keeping aside the casualties and life losses, 
            only the property damage and economic loss were humongous. 
            But Houston stood strong and became one of the cities to lead 
            the country out of the crisis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What made Houston into the ‘Space City’ we know today? 
            NASA announced Houston as the new location of their 
            Staffed Space Center on September 19, 1961, forever 
            putting the city on the map of America’s space missions. 
            It became the home to the Apollo and Mercury spacecraft 
            astronauts. Eight years later, America became the first 
            and only country till date to land on the moon, as Neil 
            Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins made their 
            way to space in Apollo 11.  Half a century later, Houston 
            is now hoping to take an even bigger leap for humankind, 
            hoping to reach Mars this time.
